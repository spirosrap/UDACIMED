## **Congratulations!** 

You have completed the model baseline analysis! This foundational work will guide all subsequent optimization efforts.

### **Summary: Key findings**
Document your analysis results using this framework:

1.  **Overall performance profile**: 

- Baseline latency: 36.9 ms single-sample (p95: 50.6 ms; std: 6.9 ms).
- Baseline throughput: 40.7 samples/sec for the profiled batch (single-sample path: 27.1 sps).
- Computational load: ~58.2 GFLOPs for the profiled input; PyTorch profiler shows ~88% of time in convolution ops.
- Memory: peak process memory ~1.56 GB; parameters ~42.6 MB, input ~1.5 MB → activations dominate.
- Architecture note: inputs are 64×64 but are upsampled to 224×224 in the model forward() to match ImageNet pretraining → a 12.25× pixel increase (224^2/64^2) that propagates through early layers.

- Targets (README): <100 MB memory, >2,000 sps throughput, >98% sensitivity, <3 ms latency.
- Current baseline meets sensitivity but misses memory, throughput and latency by large margins (≈1.56 GB, 40.7 sps, 36.9 ms).
- With architectural changes (eliminate 64→224 upsampling; depthwise/Grouped convs; lighter stem) + mixed precision and deployment acceleration (ONNX/TensorRT), the gaps are addressable in later phases.

2. **Bottlenecks**: 

- Compute bottleneck: Convolutions dominate (~88% of profiled time); 3×3 convs in residual blocks at higher resolutions are primary contributors.
- Memory bottleneck: Peak ~1.56 GB is driven by activations in early layers where spatial maps are largest; parameters are only ~43 MB.
- Latency bottleneck: Single-sample path ≈37 ms; variance (p95≈50.6 ms) suggests kernel launch/CPU scheduling overhead on CPU.
- Did you notice? 64×64 inputs are interpolated to 224×224 inside forward(), inflating both compute and activation memory by ~12.25× in the stem and first blocks. Removing this is the single biggest win.

3. **Architecture optimization**:

**Checkpoint 1 – Architecture**<br>
- Candidates for grouped/depthwise separable convolutions: the 3×3 convs in BasicBlocks across layers 2–4; they account for most FLOPs while maintaining channel sizes divisible by typical groups.
- First 7×7 stem conv at 224×224 is expensive; replacing with 3×3 stack (or a stride-2 3×3) reduces FLOPs and improves cache locality.
- Linear classifier (512→2) is negligible for both parameters and compute – not a bottleneck.
- Channel pruning/low‑rank factorization can target late-stage 3×3 convs with high redundancy while guarding sensitivity.

4. **Hardware deployment optimization**: 

**Checkpoint 2 – Deployment**<br>
- Mixed precision (FP16) is highly applicable: workload is dominated by conv/GEMM; expect ~1.5–2.0× speedup and ~50% activation/parameter memory reduction on Tensor Core GPUs.
- Batch‑size strategy: for real‑time, use batch=1 (focus on median and p95); for throughput, increase to 8–32 until latency/VRAM plateau.
- Runtime: export to ONNX and run with ONNX Runtime/TensorRT EP to fuse ops and maximize GPU utilization.

### **Recommended optimization roadmap**

Based on the analysis, prioritize the optimization techniques and highlight the estimated combined impact on optimization goals for each phase:

**Phase 1 (Quick Wins):**

- Remove 64→224 interpolation; train/finetune at native 64–128 input with an adjusted stem (3×3).
- Replace heavy 3×3 convs with depthwise‑separable (depthwise + 1×1 pointwise) or grouped convs where channels permit.
- Consider inverted residual blocks (MobileNetV2‑style) in high‑resolution stages.

- Enable FP16 inference; calibrate threshold to preserve >98% sensitivity.
- Export to ONNX and accelerate with TensorRT/ONNX Runtime EP; use dynamic batch for screening pipelines.

- Order‑of‑magnitude impact estimate (on T4‑class GPU):
  • Remove upsampling: up to ~12× less compute/activations in early blocks.
  • Depthwise/grouped convs on 3×3 layers: ~3–8× layer‑wise FLOP reduction.
  • FP16 + TensorRT: additional ~1.5–2.5×. Combined, a >20× speed/throughput gain is realistic while cutting memory to <100 MB.

**Phase 2 (Extra Impact):**

- Quantization‑aware training to INT8 (post‑validation) for edge targets.
- Fuse BatchNorm into conv at export; prefer static shapes for better kernel selection.
- Profile multiple batch sizes to locate the knee point for your hardware.

- Deployment‑side optimizations above typically add another 1.2–2.0× beyond architecture changes and enable scaling to high‑volume screening workloads.
